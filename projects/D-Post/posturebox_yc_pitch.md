# PostureBox — YC Pitch (1–2 minute script)

## One-liner
PostureBox is a privacy-first desk companion that coaches healthy sitting posture using **on-device pose estimation**—no video leaves the device.

## Problem
Desk workers sit for 6–10 hours a day and build poor posture habits. The current options are either:
- wearables that people stop wearing, or
- camera apps that feel creepy because video goes to the cloud,
and one-off ergonomic consults don’t change daily behavior.

## Solution
PostureBox sits on your desk like a small clock. It uses a camera to compute a skeleton locally and detects **sustained** slouching or asymmetry. It gives a gentle cue—like a subtle LED or a desktop notification—and tracks your progress over time. By default, only posture **scores and trends** sync; images never leave the device.

## Why now
On-device pose models are finally fast and good enough to run on low-cost edge hardware. Privacy expectations have also increased—people don’t want “always-on webcam to cloud” products.

## Product demo (what we show)
- Live local skeleton overlay (processed on-device)
- “Slouch sustained for 45 seconds” → gentle cue
- Daily dashboard: minutes neutral vs slouched + trend line

## Market
Hundreds of millions of desk workers globally. Start with remote/hybrid knowledge workers and expand to teams/employers who already spend on wellness and ergonomics.

## Business model
- D2C: device + optional subscription for advanced coaching and analytics
- B2B: per-seat/month for privacy-preserving reporting and rollout tools

## Traction (what we’ll get quickly)
We’re starting software-first: a webcam MVP to prove retention. Our goal is 50 weekly active users and strong 7-day retention before scaling hardware.

## Moat
- Privacy-first system design
- Calibration + posture scoring know-how
- Dataset of posture patterns (opt-in) and continuous improvements
- Distribution into workplaces over time

## Ask
We’re raising to ship the MVP, prove retention + willingness to pay, and build the first production-ready desk device for pilots.

## YC Application Snippets

### What’s new about you?
You’re building posture coaching that works without cloud video: on-device processing + default aggregate-only sync.

### Who needs this and why?
Remote/hybrid desk workers who spend long hours seated and want a non-invasive way to build healthier habits.

### What’s the business model?
Hardware sales + subscription; later employer plans with aggregated reporting.

### What are the next milestones?
1) webcam MVP, 2) retention & WTP, 3) desk device prototype, 4) paid pilots.

News Butler: 
A **Flutter Butler** that delivers a **personalized daily news briefing**. During onboarding, users select their location, interests, favorite sports teams, and preferred news sources. Each day, the butler automatically gathers relevant news, summarizes what matters most, and presents a concise, easy-to-read briefing—helping users stay informed without endless scrolling.

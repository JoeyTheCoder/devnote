- the svg grid behind the hero section should be a bit more visible, i like how it's fading from top left corner to be visible in the bototm right corner, it can just be more visible on the bottom right.
- the text "Fullstack Software Engineer / DevOps Engineer / Agile Leader Based in Switzerland 🇨🇭" shall have an animation as if it's typed in when loading the website
- the buttons in the hero section blend into the background color too much and should be more visible.
- the arrow button at the bottom of the page should trigger a scroll to the next section
- the about me section has quite some text and can be presented better (more readable)
- The scrolling animations triggered by the buttons from the hero section and every other hero section should respect that the navbar at the top is fixed and should calculate the scroll position to be including the navbar at the top
- Skills section looks too boring, more color, more flashy representation of all the technical skills i have (i'm open for input here)
- My professional career there is not visible timeline, the idea is that i have a line from top to bottom and then changing on the left and right to have the career milestones 
- footer needs to be reworked as

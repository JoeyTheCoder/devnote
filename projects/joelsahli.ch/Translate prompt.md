I have redesigned my personal web portfolio and the last part is to translate the text into German (swiss grammar, meaning no ß but ss)

For that i would like to setup a translation json file containing all the texts and to replace the current text blocks with the objects. 

I want the page to be able to switch between languages seemlessly without reloading

Stay true to the current text when translating.

Please make this implementation and tell me when i can test it.

what i kept

I build software people enjoy using. I explain the process in plain language and partner with product teams to turn tricky problems into simple, human-friendly products.

I help deliver great UX, production-ready code, and DevOps that scales with your ambitions. I'm always learning and excited by interesting challenges — if you'd like someone who gets things done without the jargon, let's talk.

### How I help teams

From rapid prototypes to regulated enterprise systems, I bridge architecture, delivery, and mentoring so teams can move with confidence.

- ▹Design resilient frontends (Angular, Vite, Tailwind) that stay lightweight.
- ▹Build cloud-ready APIs and integrations powered by Java, .NET, and Python.
- ▹Automate release pipelines with IaC, Kubernetes, and Azure DevOps.

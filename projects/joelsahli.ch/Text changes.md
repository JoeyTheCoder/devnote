I build software people enjoy using. I explain the process in plain language and partner with product teams to turn tricky problems into simple, human-friendly products.

I help deliver great UX, production-ready code, and DevOps that scales with your ambitions. I'm always learning and excited by interesting challenges — if you'd like someone who gets things done without the jargon, let's talk.

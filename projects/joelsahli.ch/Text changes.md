About me section:

what i kept

I build software people enjoy using. I explain the process in plain language and partner with product teams to turn tricky problems into simple, human-friendly products.

I help deliver great UX, production-ready code, and DevOps that scales with your ambitions. I'm always learning and excited by interesting challenges — if you'd like someone who gets things done without the jargon, let's talk.


Help teams section:

### How I help teams

From sketch to scale: I connect good architecture with dependable delivery so businesses can move confidently.

- Frontends that feel snappy and are easy to maintain (Angular, Vite, Tailwind).
- APIs and integrations built for reliability and clarity (Java, .NET, Python).
- Repeatable release pipelines and infra-as-code using Kubernetes and Azure DevOps.

### Ways of working

Scrum‑savvy full‑stack developer who builds products tailored to your needs. I use practical rhythms where they help, then focus on delivering the right outcomes — not selling process, shipping product.

- Product-first delivery: align roadmap and work to measurable outcomes.
- Hands-on development across frontend and backend.
- Pairing, code reviews, and a quality-first engineering mindset.

Let’s align on your roadmap and build solutions that stakeholders can trust.


What i wanna say here:

I want to show off that i'm a scrum master a little bit but i more want to tell the customer here that i'm a freelance fullstack developer that understands business needs and is driven by a passion for programming

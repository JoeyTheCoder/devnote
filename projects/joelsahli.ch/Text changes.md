what i kept

I build software people enjoy using. I explain the process in plain language and partner with product teams to turn tricky problems into simple, human-friendly products.

I help deliver great UX, production-ready code, and DevOps that scales with your ambitions. I'm always learning and excited by interesting challenges — if you'd like someone who gets things done without the jargon, let's talk.

### How I help teams

From sketch to scale: I connect good architecture with dependable delivery so businesses can move confidently.

- Frontends that feel snappy and are easy to maintain (Angular, Vite, Tailwind).
- APIs and integrations built for reliability and clarity (Java, .NET, Python).
- Repeatable release pipelines and infra-as-code using Kubernetes and Azure DevOps.

# The Dragon’s Gambit — Game Rules

## Overview

The Dragon’s Gambit is a turn-based digital card game of hidden information, memory, bluffing, and risk management. Players strive to end each round with the lowest total value in their hand, despite only partially knowing the contents of their own cards. The game’s core tension comes from deciding when to trigger the end of the round with incomplete information.

## Components

- Custom deck of cards (numeric and special ability cards; fantasy theme)
- 2–6 players per game

## Card Values (Initial Reference — Adaptable)

| Card   | Value      | Amount in Deck |
| ------ | ---------- | -------------- |
| 0 & 13 | Face value | 2x per card    |
| 1-12   | Face value | 4x per card    |


_Face cards may have unique abilities or effects — see the "Special Abilities" section._

## Setup

1. Shuffle the deck.
2. Deal 4 cards face-down to each player, arranged as a 2×2 grid.
3. Each player may look at exactly 2 of their own cards (typically the ones closest to them), then returns them face-down — these must be remembered.
4. Place the remaining deck face-down as the draw pile.
5. Flip the top card of the deck face-up to form the discard pile.

## Objective

To have the lowest total value in your hand at the moment the round ends.

## Turn Structure

Each turn, a player must take one of these actions:

### 1. Draw from the Draw Pile
- Draw the top card in secret and examine it.
- Either:
    - Swap it with one card in your hand (place the swapped-out card face-up on the discard pile)
    - Discard it immediately (face-up, no swap)

### 2. Take the Top Discard
- Take the top card from the discard pile (visible to all).
- Swap it with one of your hand’s cards, discarding the replaced card face-up.

### 3. Call “Final Gambit” (Endgame Trigger)
- Instead of drawing, a player may call "Final Gambit" (analogous to calling "Cabo") if they believe they have the lowest hand.
- This ends their turn and triggers the endgame: each other player gets one last turn, then hands are revealed and scored.
- You do not take another action after calling Final Gambit.

## Round End & Scoring

- All players reveal their hands.
- Sum the value of each player’s cards.
- The player with the lowest total value wins the round.

### Penalty Rule
- If the player who called Final Gambit does not have the lowest hand, they receive a penalty (e.g., +10 points or as agreed).
- The player with the actual lowest hand wins.

## Memory & Information

- After the initial peek, players cannot look at their own cards again unless affected by special card abilities.
- Players may: recall, deduce, and bluff.
- All discards are visible, providing indirect information.

## Special Abilities (Variant / To Be Defined)

Many special cards can add effects, such as:

| Card | Ability                                                     |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 8    | Add +1 to the value to any card of a player                 |
| 9    | peek at another players card                                |
| 10   | inspect one of your own cards                               |
| 11   | Subtract 1 of the value to any card of a player             |
| 12   | swap one of your own cards with one of your opponents cards |
| 0    | S                                                           |



_These are defined by the final deck design and can be customized for The Dragon's Gambit._

## End of Game (Multi-Round Play)

- Play multiple rounds, accumulating player scores.
- Once a player reaches a set score threshold (e.g., 100 points), the game ends. Lowest total score wins.

## Key Game Design Insights

- The emotional core is the endgame call, forcing psychological gambits.
- Players have more hidden self-information than opponent info.
- Complexity should arise from player decisions, not rule tangle.
- Special abilities should manipulate information, not simply replace it.

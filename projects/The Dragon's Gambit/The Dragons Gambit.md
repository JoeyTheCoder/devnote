# The Dragon’s Gambit

## High-Level Concept
**The Dragon’s Gambit** is a turn-based digital card game that blends **poker-like risk**, **hidden information**, and **memory** into a tense, strategic experience.  
Players must make deliberate gambits under uncertainty, deciding when to reveal, swap, or hold information while bluffing opponents.

The game is inspired by classic hidden-hand card games (e.g., Cabo-like mechanics) but is fully original in rules, presentation, and theme.

## Core Pillars
- **Hidden Information** – Players never see the full state of their hand.
- **Memory & Deduction** – Success comes from remembering partial reveals and tracking probabilities.
- **Meaningful Gambits** – Every action carries risk; players must commit to imperfect knowledge.
- **Short, Tense Matches** – Games are fast, readable, and replayable.
- **Premium Feel** – Clean UI, restrained fantasy tone, minimal clutter, strong visual hierarchy.

## Theme & Tone
- **Fantasy strategy**, grounded and non-cringey
- Dragons as symbolic figures of intellect, patience, and cold calculation
- Ice/blue dragon imagery is a central visual motif
- Mood: calm tension, silence, restraint, calculated risk

---

## Gameplay Overview
- Each player holds a small hand of cards, some hidden from themselves.
- Players take turns drawing, swapping, revealing, or activating card abilities.
- Cards have numeric values and occasional abilities that affect information, control, or risk.
- The goal is to end the round with the **lowest total value**, choosing the right moment to call the final gambit.
- Bluffing and misdirection are valid and encouraged.

---

## Platform Goals
- **PC (Steam)** and **Mobile (iOS / Android)**
- Identical core rules across platforms
- UI adapted for mouse vs touch, but consistent visual language

---

## Monetization (Design-Friendly)
- PC: Low-price premium game
- Mobile: Free-to-play with cosmetic unlocks and optional quality-of-life purchases
- No pay-to-win mechanics

---

## UI / UX Principles
- Strong visual hierarchy (player always knows what matters)
- Consistent spacing, typography, and motion
- Clear feedback for:
  - Card draws
  - Reveals
  - Swaps
  - Ability triggers
  - End-of-round results
- Animations are short, readable, and purposeful

---

## Technical Direction
- Built in **Unity**
- Clear separation between:
  - **Game Rules** (pure logic, engine-agnostic)
  - **Game State** (data only)
  - **Presentation Layer** (Unity UI, animations, VFX)
- Designed for easy iteration, balance changes, and polish

---

## What Success Looks Like
- A game that feels immediately understandable but rewards mastery
- Players describe it as “poker meets memory”
- Matches feel tense but fair
- The game feels deliberate, not noisy or bloated

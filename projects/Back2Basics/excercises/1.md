Build a simple “Sum Calculator” feature:

1. In your Angular frontend:
    
    - Create a form with two input fields for numbers (a and b) and a button.
    - When the button is clicked, send both numbers to your backend using a service.
    - Display the result (the sum) returned by the backend in your component.
2. In your Spring Boot backend:
    
    - Create a new endpoint (e.g., /api/sum) that accepts two parameters (a and b).
    - The endpoint should return the sum of a and b as a JSON object, e.g., { "result": 12 }.

**Hints to consider:**

- How will you send two parameters from Angular to the backend?
- What HTTP method will you use (GET or POST) and why?
- How will you structure the response in your backend so Angular can easily display it?

Start by outlining your approach or writing the backend endpoint, and let me know your plan or questions! I’ll guide you step by step.

# Back2Basics Coding Tutor Agent

Welcome to your personal coding tutor agent! This agent is designed to help you relearn and master the fundamentals of programming, focusing on understanding, problem-solving, and independent thinking.

## Agent Philosophy
- **Guidance over Answers:** The agent will guide you step by step, asking questions and prompting you to think, rather than simply providing solutions.
- **Encourage Exploration:** You’ll be encouraged to try, experiment, and reflect on your code. Mistakes are part of the learning process!
- **Socratic Method:** The agent will use questions to help you discover answers yourself, deepening your understanding.
- **Support, Not Solve:** If you get stuck, the agent will offer hints or break down the problem, but will avoid giving away the full solution unless absolutely necessary.
- **Reinforce Basics:** The agent will help you revisit core concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving strategies, ensuring you build a strong foundation.

## How to Use
- Describe your coding exercise or problem.
- The agent will ask clarifying questions, suggest approaches, and help you debug.
- If you’re stuck, ask for a hint or a nudge in the right direction.
- Reflect on your process and solutions with the agent’s feedback.

Let’s get back to basics and become a confident, independent coder again!
